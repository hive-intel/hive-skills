description: Use this skill when the user asks about prediction markets — Polymarket or Kalshi events, markets, outcomes, odds, prices, liquidity, stats, traders, holders, or trades — including "what are the odds of X", "find markets about Y", or comparing venues. Use it whenever live prediction-market evidence is needed. Never present market probability as ground truth.

# hive-prediction-markets — Prediction Markets

Discover and analyze prediction markets — Polymarket, Kalshi — with prices,
liquidity, outcomes, traders, and trades, always framed as market-implied
odds rather than truth.

## Task toolset and identifiers

Toolset: `prediction_markets`. Read `hive://toolsets/prediction_markets` before
execution; it is authoritative for the current output schema, material-call
budget, phases, fallback condition, and stop conditions.

- Required: market id, event id, token id, trader address, or a search query —
  depending on the request.
- Optional: status filter, limit, date range, outcome, liquidity threshold.

If the user starts with a topic, search candidates first and ask for selection
when multiple markets match — similar markets can have different resolution
criteria.

Before choosing endpoints, select exactly one matching entry from the exact
workflow's routes[]. Follow its ordered steps, use a fallback only under that
step's published condition, stop at four material calls, and preserve the
selected route_id in the typed result. The broad coverageCatalog is discovery
coverage, not an execution plan.

## Procedure

1. Call `search_tools` for prediction-market search, event, market, stats,
   holder, trader, or trade capabilities.
2. Call `get_api_endpoint_schema` for each endpoint before calling it.
3. Search events/markets for topic prompts; resolve exact market/event/token
   ids before pulling stats, holders, or trades.
4. Add liquidity/volume and freshness context before interpreting prices.
5. Report market price, volume/liquidity, outcomes, provider/source, and
   freshness — and never present probability as ground truth.

## Bounded calls

- Use small search limits and page through only when needed.
- Do not fetch all trades or holders unless the user asks for a deep dive.
- Keep outcome-token prices separate from event-level interpretation.

## Worked example

User: "What are the odds on the next Fed rate decision? Compare Polymarket
and Kalshi if both have markets."

1. `search_tools` → `{"query": "prediction markets search events fed rate decision", "limit": 5}`
2. `get_api_endpoint_schema` for the market-search endpoint returned, then
   `invoke_api_endpoint` with a bounded search per venue.
3. If several markets match, list candidates with resolution criteria and ask
   which to inspect — or pick the highest-liquidity exact match and say so.
4. Report outcome prices with volume/liquidity and freshness, framed as
   market-implied odds.

## Report template

```markdown
## Summary
[Market/event read and top outcomes in one or two sentences.]

## Calls made
- Toolset: prediction_markets
- Endpoint(s): [exact endpoint names]
- Identifiers: [market/event/token/trader ids]

## Evidence
- Outcomes and prices: [per outcome, per venue]
- Liquidity/volume: [values + as-of]
- Provenance: [provider, fetched_at, observed_at/cache_age_ms, runtime status per call]

## Caveats
[Market probability is not truth, thin liquidity, stale stats, candidate ambiguity.]

## Next action
[Inspect selected market, holders, trades, or related events — only if needed.]
```

## Gotchas

- Market prices reflect trading and liquidity, not verified probability.
- Similar markets can have different resolution criteria — quote them when
  comparing venues.
- Event-level and outcome-token-level data are not interchangeable.

## Evidence receipt (required)

End every Hive-backed answer with a compact receipt built from the `_hive`
object on each material tool response:

- `provider`, `tool`, `fetched_at`, `observed_at`, `cache_age_ms`, and `runtime_status`
- `receipt_id`, `receipt_version`, server/build version, and SHA-256 input/result
  digests when present (self-checks, not signatures)
- `source`, `cache_status`, `truncated`, and any warnings
- canonical chain/entity identifiers plus block, slot, transaction, or query ids
  present in provider data
- material provider disagreements and how they were handled
- checks that were unavailable, gated, stale, truncated, or intentionally not run
- a `claims[]` citation from each material statement to exact receipt IDs
- one `coverage[]` entry for every canonical evidence phase, with each gap explained

Never turn missing evidence into a clean result, silently merge conflicting
provider values, or omit a degraded/fallback call from the receipt.
`observed_at` is Hive's first-observation/original cache-population time, and
`cache_age_ms: 0` only means newly retrieved by Hive. Use provider time, block,
slot, transaction, or candle close for source recency; if absent, mark it
unknown. Run `validate_task_result` before presenting the typed workflow result;
it checks structure but cannot authenticate an invented receipt.

## Runtime status handling

If a market search succeeds but stats are `degraded`, return the candidates
and label the missing market details clearly.

## Hand-offs

- General crypto market prices → `hive-market-research`.
- A trader's full wallet activity → `hive-wallet-investigation`.
- Standing "alert me when odds move" requests → `hive-stateful-monitoring`.
