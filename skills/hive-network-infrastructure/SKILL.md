description: Use this skill when the user asks about chain state or transaction plumbing — gas prices, blocks, transaction receipts and status ("did my tx go through"), event logs, supported networks, fee data, or RPC diagnostics. Use it whenever the answer needs current chain-level evidence. For wallet holdings use hive-wallet-investigation; for Solana slots/fees use hive-solana-analysis.

# hive-network-infrastructure — Network Infrastructure

Read chain state — gas, blocks, receipts, logs, transaction status, supported
networks — and run RPC diagnostics with auditable, timestamped evidence.

## Task toolset and identifiers

Toolset: `network_infrastructure`. Read
`hive://toolsets/network_infrastructure` before execution; it is authoritative
for the current output schema, material-call budget, phases, fallback
condition, and stop conditions.

- Required: chain/network.
- Optional: block number/hash, transaction hash, contract address, log
  filter, account address, time window.

Ask for the exact chain plus transaction/block identifiers before status
checks — a transaction hash is not globally unique without chain context.

Before choosing endpoints, select exactly one matching entry from the exact
workflow's routes[]. Follow its ordered steps, use a fallback only under that
step's published condition, stop at four material calls, and preserve the
selected route_id in the typed result. The broad coverageCatalog is discovery
coverage, not an execution plan.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the chain/network id.
2. Use `filter_networks` when comparing chains by current liquidity,
   transactions, or volume. Otherwise call `search_tools` for gas, block,
   transaction, receipt, log, supported-network, or RPC-diagnostic
   capabilities.
3. Call `get_api_endpoint_schema` for each endpoint before calling it.
4. Use current-state tools for gas and block questions; use
   transaction/receipt/log tools only with exact identifiers.
5. Report the block/slot/fetched time so the answer is auditable.

## Bounded calls

- Bound log queries by block range and topics.
- Do not run broad chain scans for a single transaction question.
- Retry transient RPC failures once when appropriate.

## Worked example

User: "Did my transaction go through? Hash is 0x… — I think it was on Base."

1. Confirm the chain (Base) and the exact hash.
2. `search_tools` → `{"query": "transaction receipt status base", "limit": 5}`
3. `get_api_endpoint_schema` for the receipt/status endpoint returned, then
   `invoke_api_endpoint` with schema-valid arguments.
4. Report status, block number, gas used, and the fetched time. If the
   receipt is missing, say whether that means pending, dropped, or wrong
   chain — do not guess success.

## Report template

```markdown
## Summary
[Network or transaction state in one or two sentences.]

## Calls made
- Toolset: network_infrastructure
- Endpoint(s): [exact endpoint names]
- Identifiers: [chain, hash/block/address, filters]

## Evidence
- State: [block/slot, gas/fee, receipt/log/status]
- Provenance: [provider, fetched_at, observed_at/cache_age_ms, runtime status per call]

## Caveats
[Provider mismatch, stale block, rate limit, incomplete logs.]

## Next action
[Narrower log filter, alternate provider, or retry — only if needed.]
```

## Gotchas

- A transaction hash is not globally unique without chain context.
- Logs require bounded block ranges.
- HTTP health does not prove provider data freshness.

## Evidence receipt (required)

End every Hive-backed answer with a compact receipt built from the `_hive`
object on each material tool response:

- `provider`, `tool`, `fetched_at`, `observed_at`, `cache_age_ms`, and `runtime_status`
- `receipt_id`, `receipt_version`, server/build version, and SHA-256 input/result
  digests when present (self-checks, not signatures)
- `source`, `cache_status`, `truncated`, and any warnings
- canonical chain/entity identifiers plus block, slot, transaction, or query ids
  present in provider data
- material provider disagreements and how they were handled
- checks that were unavailable, gated, stale, truncated, or intentionally not run
- a `claims[]` citation from each material statement to exact receipt IDs
- one `coverage[]` entry for every canonical evidence phase, with each gap explained

Never turn missing evidence into a clean result, silently merge conflicting
provider values, or omit a degraded/fallback call from the receipt.
`observed_at` is Hive's first-observation/original cache-population time, and
`cache_age_ms: 0` only means newly retrieved by Hive. Use provider time, block,
slot, transaction, or candle close for source recency; if absent, mark it
unknown. Run `validate_task_result` before presenting the typed workflow result;
it checks structure but cannot authenticate an invented receipt.

## Runtime status handling

Use `ok`, `invalid_input`, `missing_key`, `plan_required`, `rate_limited`,
`degraded`, and `failing`. For transient RPC failures, retry once or fall back to another
network read and state the limitation.

## Hand-offs

- Wallet balances/holdings rather than chain state → `hive-wallet-investigation`.
- Solana slots, priority fees, parsed transactions → `hive-solana-analysis`.
- Gas context for a risky transaction → pair with `hive-security-risk`.
